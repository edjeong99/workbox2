this is a project to try to implement PWA using workbox.
This project is deployed at https://edworkbox2.surge.sh


I am using a simple todo app as an example.  The code for the todo app is from https://code-maven.com/todo-in-html-and-javascript with some modification by me.

I am following instruction about PWA from below site.  This guide is about creating/registering a service worker and simple cache.

To make the in-app installation, I followed below guide
